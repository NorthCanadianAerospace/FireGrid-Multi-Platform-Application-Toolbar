---

To achieve this objective of making a single Application Toolbar product that can create, manage and run the smallest one-person operation to the largest global organization, we have conducted basic and applied research since 1999 into video/audio compression algorithms, multimedia recording, processing and display engines, user interface technologies, advanced encryption & authentication systems, grid-based networking technologies and low-level database organization & access systems.

Our advanced research & development allows us to create multimedia playback, recording and authoring systems that require little or no involvement of programmers or software engineers. These authoring systems are able to use their built-in intelligence to gather various inputs from the end-user and then understand the meaning and intent of the subject matter expert or graphics artist before creating a Secure Multimedia Display, Communications and Hardware Control system.

Our FireGrid Media Engine is developed for and marketed as a both a programming library and as an interactive end-user toolbar to companies that require fast and easy ways to create platform-independent distributed Grid Processors which can drive and connect to massive databases that comprise petabytes and greater sizes of data ranging from simple text-based word processing documents, spreadsheets and PDF files up to very large libraries of still photos, interactive presentations, audio files, video files and binary data files and metadata streams of all types and sizes. From there, these massive databases can be used locally and globally to design, create, manufacture, manage, update and distribute multimedia content and hard-good products on local or global basis all using the built-in applications and toolsets embedded into the single-executable-file FireGrid Application Toolbar!

The FireGrid Application Toolbar acts as a virtual supercomputer that aggregates all the available local-machine and networked CPU, GPU and DSP horsepower of your under-utilized servers, desktop machines, notebooks, tablets and even smartphones and smartwatches to form a smart-grid of assignable computer horsepower. Individual users and groups can request specific amounts of processing power and the FireGrid system will automatically group-together disparate computers of varying hardware platforms, disparate processing horsepower and varying operating systems to form a centrally-managed job-specific virtual supercomputer. 

These processing nodes can be located anywhere on the world but will remain fully secured using our encrypted URF (Universal Resource File) data containers and our fully-secured and encrypted Internet communications system. This grid processing horsepower can now be used by any authorized single or group of users in a centrally managed or independent manner to perform common tasks related to GIS (Graphical Information Systems), 2D-XY and 3D-XYZ imaging, CAD/CAM/FEA (Computer Aided Design and Machining, Finite Element Analysis), 3D-printing and CNC machining, real-time multimedia streaming, high quality encrypted audio and video communications and any other tasks that your company can imagine and create. 

Our built-in C/C++ and Object Pascal IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and compiler system ensures speedy design and deployment of your mission-critical applications that can be scaled up and out from a single-user up to enterprise-class cloud network applications that have Billions of simultaneous users and Billions of Input/Output operations per second!

3) Built-In and Always-On Quantum computing-resistant encryption of stored-data and realtime audio, video and text communications using multiple encryption formats. The advanced object-oriented file and folder management system allows for full-encrypted virtual storage volumes that can be of any size and spanned across anywhere on the local network or the global internet into the Yottabytes and larger volume sizes. The encryption library supports both legacy encryption along with the latest quantum-computing-resistant ones such as:

Encryption of the FireGrid runtime library uses multiple industry-standard and custom encryption algorithms with very large encrypt/decrypt keys to ensure the security of the FireGrid Toolbar and API library itself plus all data and applications created by end-users. A built-in verification engine ensures that the FireGrid Toolbar, API library and the applications that use it are validated with proper digital signatures indicating the verified sources of your software. Since encryption is ALWAYS ON, all data that resides within our secured URF (Universal Resource File) container files are automatically protected to commercial-level and above data security standards.

4) Automated data indexing and categorization is standard. The object-oriented integrated development environment allows fast development of Easy-to-Use and Highly Scalable Applications with built-in auto-gridding that can process huge single and multi-dimensional data arrays up to 33 dimensions coupled to user interfaces that look and act the same no matter the platform.

5) Secured and Encrypted End-user Toolbar Application and FireGrid API Library Server that lets the applications that you create with the FireGrid IDE use and manage both local machine and network gridded CPU/GPU/DSP routines that can run on your local machine, your local area network or a globally-gridded network of computers made up of a connected group of any type of fixed-base or mobile computer system.
